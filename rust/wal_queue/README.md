A write-ahead log (WAL) is a pattern used in database systems to ensure data durability and consistency. The WAL pattern involves writing log entries to a separate log file before making changes to the database, and then using the log entries to recover the database in the event of a failure or crash.

To implement a write-ahead log pattern in Rust, you would need to use a library or framework that provides support for this pattern, such as Diesel or the Rust SQLite bindings. Here is an example using the SQLite crate:



In this example, we open a connection to a SQLite database, enable the write-ahead log mode, and then execute some SQL statements that modify the database. The rusqlite::Connection type automatically manages the write-ahead log for us, so we don't have to worry about writing the log entries ourselves. When we're finished making changes, we commit the transaction to make the changes permanent, and then close the connection to the database.
