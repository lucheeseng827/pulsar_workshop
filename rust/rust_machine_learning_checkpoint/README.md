To create a machine learning model checkpointing pattern in Rust while doing retraining, you can use the std::fs module, which provides support for working with the file system, and the bincode crate, which provides support for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures to and from binary data.


In this example, the Model struct represents a machine learning model. The Model::save method is used to serialize the model to a binary format and save it to a file, and the Model::load method is used to load the model from a file and deserialize it.

In main, we create a Model instance and save it to a file using the Model::save method. We then load the model from the file using the Model::load method.

You can use this pattern to save and load your model at regular intervals during training, so that you can resume training from a previously saved checkpoint if necessary.
