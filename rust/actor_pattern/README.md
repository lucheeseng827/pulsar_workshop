The actor pattern is a way of organizing concurrent operations in a program. In Rust, you can implement the actor pattern using the std::sync::mpsc module, which provides support for multi-producer, single-consumer message passing.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement the actor pattern in Rust using the mpsc module:

In this example, the Actor struct represents an actor that can be used to send messages to other parts of the program. The Actor struct has a single field, tx, which is a mpsc::Sender that is used to send messages to the channel.

The Actor::new method is used to create a new Actor instance, and the Actor::send method is used to send a message to the channel.

In main, we create a message channel using the mpsc::channel method, and then spawn two threads that will both receive messages from the channel. Each thread receives a shared reference to the receiver part of the channel, which they use to receive messages.

Finally, we create an Actor instance and use it to send a message to the channel. This message is received by the two threads and printed to the console.
