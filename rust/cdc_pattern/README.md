To implement change data capture (CDC) on a message queue, you will need to use a messaging system that supports CDC, such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. CDC allows you to track and capture changes to data in a database and send those changes as messages to a message queue, where they can be processed by other applications or systems.

Here are the general steps for implementing CDC on a message queue:

Configure your messaging system to enable CDC. This typically involves setting up a CDC-specific connector or plugin that can monitor the database for changes and send those changes as messages to the message queue.

Set up the database to be monitored for changes. This typically involves enabling CDC on the database, configuring the tables and columns to be monitored, and setting up any necessary filters or exclusions.

Configure the message queue to receive CDC messages. This typically involves setting up a queue or topic to receive the CDC messages, as well as any necessary routing or filtering rules to ensure that the messages are delivered to the correct consumers.

Start the CDC process. Once everything is set up, you can start the CDC connector or plugin, which will begin monitoring the database for changes and sending those changes as messages to the message queue.

Consume the CDC messages from the message queue. Applications or systems that need to receive and process the CDC messages can subscribe to the message queue and receive the messages as they are produced. They can then process the messages and take any necessary action based on the data contained in the messages.

It's important to note that the specific steps for implementing CDC on a message queue will vary depending on the messaging system you are using and the details of your particular setup. You should consult the documentation for your messaging system and CDC connector or plugin for more detailed instructions.



There are a few different approaches to implementing a change data capture pattern in Rust:

Use the Observable trait from the observable crate. This allows you to create an observable object that can be subscribed to and notified of changes.

Use the Event trait from the event crate. This allows you to create events that can be subscribed to and notified of changes.

Use the FluentBits trait from the fluent-bits crate. This allows you to create a bit-level stream of changes that can be subscribed to and notified of changes.

Use a custom implementation of the Observer pattern. This involves creating an observer struct that can be subscribed to and notified of changes, and a subject struct that maintains a list of observers and notifies them when changes occur.



To implement an actor pattern to observe a data source in Rust, you can use the actix crate. This crate provides a framework for building actor-based systems in Rust.

First, define a struct for the data source and implement the Actor trait from the actix crate. This trait allows the data source to be an actor and receive messages from other actors.

Next, define a struct for the observer and implement the Actor trait from the actix crate. This trait allows the observer to be an actor and receive messages from other actors.

Then, create an instance of the data source actor and register the observer actor as a listener for changes in the data source. The observer actor can then receive notifications whenever the data source changes.
