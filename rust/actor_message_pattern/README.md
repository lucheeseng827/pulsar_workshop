To create a message publisher and actor consuming messages in the actor pattern in Rust, you can use the std::sync::mpsc module, which provides support for multi-producer, single-consumer message passing.

In this example, the Actor struct represents an actor that consumes messages from the channel. The Actor struct has a single field, rx, which is a mpsc::Receiver that is used to receive messages from the channel.

The Actor::new method is used to create a new Actor instance, and the Actor::start method is used to spawn a new thread that will receive messages from the channel and print them to the console.

In main, we create a message channel using the mpsc::channel method, and then create an Actor instance that will consume messages from the channel. We then start the actor by calling its start method, which spawns a new thread that will receive messages from the channel.

Finally, we publish some messages to the channel using the mpsc::Sender that was returned by mpsc::channel. These messages will be received by the actor's thread and printed to the console.
